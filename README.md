# Encryption-Decryption-scripts
Generation, encryption, decryption shell scripts. RSA algorithm 2048 bit key | .sh scripts. Made for .txt

There are 3 .sh files: 
1- Generate public/private key and text file
2- Encryption of the txt file
3- Decryption of the txt file

They're just some simple scripts that include already the instructions. Nothing special. :)
